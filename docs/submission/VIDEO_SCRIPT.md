# 🎥 APEXGOV 2.0: THE 3-MINUTE DEMO SCRIPT
*Target: Indus AI Week 2026 Submission*

## 0:00 - 0:30 | The Hook (Problem)
*   **Visual**: Screen recording of the ApexGov Dashboard.
*   **Narrative**: "Manual building safety audits in Pakistan are slow, subjective, and prone to evidence tampering. Site inspectors spend hours writing reports, yet safety violations result in thousands of preventable accidents. We built ApexGov 2.0 to turn any site photo into a legally-verifiable government ticket in 4 seconds."

## 0:30 - 1:30 | The Core Demo (Live Action)
*   **Visual**: Open the app. Upload a photo with a visible violation (e.g., worker without a helmet).
*   **Narrative**: "Observe the UI. As soon as a photo is uploaded, our **Forensic Audit Layer** kicks in. It generates a cryptographic hash of the evidence and checks for AI manipulation—essential for legal admissibility. Next, our **Bimodal Audit Engine** scans the latent space. We aren't just using a chat-bot; we're running a custom-trained **YOLOv8 PPE Detector** alongside a specialized vision reasoner."

## 1:30 - 2:15 | The "Sovereign" Flex (Technical Depth)
*   **Visual**: Quickly show the Kaggle Notebook or the "Transparency HUD" in the app.
*   **Narrative**: "Data privacy is our priority. For sensitive government projects, ApexGov can switch to **Sovereign Mode**. We host our own AI inference units on local GPUs via our FastAPI bridge, ensuring public sector data never leaves the nation's control. We call this **Sovereign AI**."

## 2:15 - 3:00 | The Result (Impact)
*   **Visual**: Show the generated PDF Ticket with the QR Code and Urdu TTS button.
*   **Narrative**: "The output is a professional PDF ticket, mapped directly to the **Punjab Building Safety Act 2016**, complete with automatic fine calculation and an **Urdu Audio Report** for local site workers. ApexGov isn't just a wrapper; it's a complete, auditable governance system. We are team ApexGov, and we are automating safety for Pakistan."
