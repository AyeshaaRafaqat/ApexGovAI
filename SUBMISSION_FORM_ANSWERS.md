# 🏛️ ApexGov: Autonomous Building Safety & Compliance Agent

### 🚀 One-Liner
ApexGov is a sovereign, multimodal AI agent that automates government building safety audits using local edge-inference and forensic evidence verification.

### 🛡️ The Problem
Current safety inspections are slow, prone to human error, and suffer from 'Blind AI'—where models lack the legal context of local regulations (like the Punjab Safety Act 2016).

### 🏛️ Our Solution
ApexGov solves this with a **Bimodal Sovereign Engine**:
1. **Custom YOLO Vision**: Locally trained on 3,000+ construction safety images to detect PPE violations.
2. **Forensic Audit Layer**: Verifies if evidence is authentic to prevent insurance fraud.
3. **Regulatory RAG**: Maps visual evidence directly to the Punjab Building Code 2016 for automatic fine generation.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
-   **Frontend**: Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons.
-   **inference**: Custom-trained YOLOv11 (Kaggle T4 GPU).
-   **Logic**: Regluatory RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) mapped to Punjab legal acts.
-   **Storage**: Sovereign Local Inference (Ngrok Tunneling).
-   **Ticket Generation**: Dynamic PDF/QR Evidence Generation (html2pdf).

### 💎 Unique Value (Why we win)
- **Zero-Trust Accountability**: The Forensic HUD shows the AI's reasoning, making it transparent for both government and citizens.
- **Privacy First**: Local inference means building photos never leave the sovereign government cloud.
- **Immediate Impact**: From "Photo" to "Legal Ticket" in under 10 seconds.
